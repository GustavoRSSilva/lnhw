I'm hkjn / Henrik Jonsson, software engineer with experience building large-scale distributed systems. Since 2014
I've been spending more and more time working on understanding Bitcoin and related technology. I worked for a
Bitcoin startup during 2015, doing various infrastructure work, and since Oct 2017 I've been working independently
to learn about and educate others about Bitcoin, Lightning Network and other areas.

I was once a strong C programmer, but that was almost 10 years ago. I program in Go or Python when I have to program
at all these days. I am not at all good at UI/UX work. I have a fairly good understanding of the Bitcoin and Lightning
protocols, and have operated c-lightning mainnet nodes since start of Jan 2018, when I attended Jimmy Song's seminar
in London.

# Kaspar Etter

I studied Computer Science at ETH Zurich and work now as a software engineer at [Shift Cryptosecurity](https://shiftcrypto.ch), the company behind the BitBox hardware wallet. I'm most familiar with Java and Web programming but also got to know Golang in the last few months. I recently implemented non-segwit multisig in our software wallet, which will be released in the coming week. [www.kasparetter.com](https://www.kasparetter.com)

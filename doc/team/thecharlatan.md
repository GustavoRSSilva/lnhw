Hi, I'm Sebastian and I work at Shift Cryptosecurity/BitBox. I am also a
maintainer of Gridcoin, am re-writing the monero build system to support
deterministic builds and do some small stuff for bitcoin core (like reviewing
apiv2 and writing new/better build scripts).  I've also review some of Ledger's 
Monero support code in the monero client. 

I've spent most of the past year on build systems (both cmake and autotools), so
that is where my current forte is. Other than that I am most comfortable with
c++. I've also review some of Ledger's Monero support code in the monero
client.

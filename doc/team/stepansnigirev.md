My name is Stepan, I am switching to bitcoin and blockchain from academia (quantum physics). I have some experience with hardware devices and can make them quickly and kinda working.

## Programming languages:

- python (fluent)
- C (can read and write with dictionary)
- C++ (for embeded devices like Arduino)
- web dev - javascript, jquery, websockets, WebCryptoAPI (enough for simple web UI)

## Knowledge:

- crypto algorithms, bitcoin protocol
- basic understanding of lightning protocol without in-depth knowledge

## Codebase:

- fluent with [pybtcfork](https://github.com/jimmysong/pybtcfork) python bitcion library and use it normally for testing if I am doing everythin right and trying different things in jupyter notebook.
- author and the only user of [bitcoin library for Arduino](https://github.com/arduino-bitcoin/arduino-bitcoin)

I have been working on a Bitcoin startup called RiskBazaar for a couple of years and code in Javascript and Go. Depending on how the weekend progresses, I may try to replicate the hardware device signing using the lnd implementation and test out compatibility between lnd and c-lightning (e.g. c-lightning node serving Neutrino light clients). I'm also happy to prepare slides in advance of Sunday and help with testing, project management.

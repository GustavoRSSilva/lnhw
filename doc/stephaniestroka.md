Hi! I'm Steffi (Stephanie Stroka). I work as a software engineer at Shift CryptoSecurity, the company behind the BitBox hardware wallet.
I'm familar with C programming on firmware, Java, Golang, JavaScript, a tiny bit of Python on Desktop and mobile app development with Cordova/Ionic.
My association with Bitcoin/Blockchain is rather recent, being a long-term Blockchain skeptic (especially due to the recent hype that it got and because
there are so many people that believe that climate change and world hunger, and what not, can be solved with Blockchain ;-)). 

I'm usually pretty good in prototyping stuff, but I require more time to understand cryptography than the average guy here, I guess. 

Here to learn about lightning and contribute wherever I can on firmware or the Desktop app.
